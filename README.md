# Voshi's Personal Photo Album

My **first** flutter project.
A personal cloud to upload, view, save and delete your pictures/folders.

## Usage:
- Ngrok: Used on Raspberry pi to serve as a server. Must use the URL provided by them as the 'baseUrl'.
- JWT token in order for each user to access the server and retrieve information.

## To implement:
- Increased security.
- Increased error handling.

# Changes:
- Currently Javascript is being used in the backend, this will not scale well. "Go" will be used to account for scalability.
