# Voshi's Personal Photo Album

My **first** flutter project.
A personal cloud to upload, view, save and delete your pictures/folders.

## Usage:
- Ngrok: Used on Raspberry pi to serve as a server. Must use the URL provided by them as the 'baseUrl'.
- Basic-Auth: Used to log in. (Will require username and password every call).

## To implement:
- Increased security.
- Increased error handling.
